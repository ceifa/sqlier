# Sqlier
Are you tired of these lots of heavy database libraries which do a lot of things which you don't need? You came at the right place! This project aims to offer a way of writing a very simple code only one time and be able to switch between multiple database drivers without problems. The most easier and lightweight database abstraction of the market!

> Alert: This project will not fill all the edge database cases and does not aim to do so.

## Documentation
You can find the library documentaion [here](https://github.com/ceifa/sqlier/wiki).

## Logs

To enable the querying logs, set the convar `sqlier_logs` to `1`. Error logs will always log at the console and to the `data/sqlier` folder, at the `errors.txt` file.
